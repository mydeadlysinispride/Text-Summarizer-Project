# Text-Summarizer-Project

## Overview
This project focuses on text summarization using HuggingFace transformer models. The primary objective is to explore the capabilities of transformer models in the context of text summarization tasks.

As part of the learning process and to deepen understanding of Transformer models, this project experiments with implementing a text summarization model using TensorFlow.
